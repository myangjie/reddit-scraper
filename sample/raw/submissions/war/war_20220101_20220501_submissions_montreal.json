J'suis un jeune \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9; c'est la premi\u00e8re fois que je soumets un post au subreddit de Montr\u00e9al. Habituellement, j'suis une personne positive avec tr\u00e8s peu de stress dans ma vie personnelle; par contre, mon anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 a derni\u00e8rement atteint des niveaux record dans le contexte de l'attaque sur l'Ukraine par la Russie. Mon anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 est compl\u00e8tement \u00e9go\u00efste dans ce contexte: c'est la possibilit\u00e9 qu'une arme nucl\u00e9aire nous atteigne qui me pr\u00e9occupe. Il y a tellement de souffrance dans le monde - par contre, j'ai l'impression que la plupart d'entre nous sont capables d'oublier cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 et de vivre notre quotidien sans avoir des pens\u00e9es vraiment existentielles. C'est horrible de le dire comme \u00e7a, mais c'est honn\u00eatement ce qu'on fait.\n\nJe viens de visionner la vid\u00e9o de Kurzgesagt [\"What if We Nuked a City?\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iPH-br_eJQ&amp;ab_channel=Kurzgesagt%E2%80%93InaNutshell) (I highly recommend the watch if you enjoy depression) et \u00e7a m'a fait penser \u00e0 une question plus ou moins concr\u00e8te.\n\nImaginez que la ville enti\u00e8re est r\u00e9veill\u00e9e \u00e0 trois heures du matin par une alarme sur nos cells qui ressemble \u00e0 celle de nos alertes \"Amber\"; apr\u00e8s qu'on ait rapidement parcourut le petit paragraphe de l'alerte, on r\u00e9alise qu'on nous pr\u00e9vient du d\u00e9but du premier conflit nucl\u00e9aire.\n\n**Quelle est votre premier r\u00e9flexe pour vous sauver, vous et votre famille/amis?** Personnellement, je n'ai jamais pris la peine de m'informer des protocoles propres \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al pour se prot\u00e9ger d'un d\u00e9sastre naturel ou d'une attaque avec des bombes (supposant que ce genre de protocole existe?). Et je parle pas n\u00e9cessairement de la guerre civile \u00e9ventuelle pour s'approprier les Costcos et la bouffe dedans, mais plut\u00f4t de votre r\u00e9action dans le moment pour ne pas imm\u00e9diatement \u00eatre pris dans un blast nucl\u00e9aire potentiel. On se pitche-tu dans les tunnels de m\u00e9tro pour \u00e9viter les impacts des explosions et les quelques jours de pluie nucl\u00e9aire?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey all. I'm a student in university; this will be the first time that I submit a post to Montreal's subreddit. I'm usually a very positive person with close to no stress in my personal life; however, my anxiety has recently reached sky-high levels in the context of Russia's attack on Ukraine. My anxiety is completely selfish within this context: I'm deadly afraid about the possibility of a nuclear weapon being dropped on us. There's so much suffering in the world - yet, I think most of us are able to forget this reality and live our daily lives without having many existential thoughts. It's horrible to just say it like that, but it's honestly what we do.\n\nI just watched Kurzgesagt's video [\"What if We Nuked a City?\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iPH-br_eJQ&amp;ab_channel=Kurzgesagt%E2%80%93InaNutshell) (je vous recommande fortement de le visionner si vous aimez \u00eatre d\u00e9prim\u00e9) and it made me come up with a more or less concrete question.\n\nImagine that the entire city is woken up at three in the morning by an alarm on our cells that sounds like the one from our Amber alerts; after we've all quickly skimmed the short paragraph of the alert, we realize that we're being warned about an impending nuclear conflict.\n\n**What would be your first reflex to save yourselves, your families, and your friends?** Personally, I never tried to learn about any protocols developed by Montreal about protecting ourselves from natural disasters or a major bomb attack (assuming any protocols like that exist?). And I'm not necessarily talking about the eventual civil war to capture the Costcos and all the food inside, but rather your reaction in the immediate moment to not get caught in a potential nuclear blast.
