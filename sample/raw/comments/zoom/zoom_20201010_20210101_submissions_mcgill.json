It's obviously not as helpful as real in-person interaction, but I am definitely getting something out of it and I'd say it's worth it for me even though it's remote! We have zoom calls twice a week with basically no \"lecture,\" just a lot of breakout rooms with a chance to interact and you should basically try to get the concept down with the homework and use class as a chance to refine/practice. And then there's also weekly discussion group video call things you're supposed to do with other people in the class which are a good chance to speak more french if you take them seriously.\n\nI mean it's like anything if you do the homework you get a good grasp of the concept and then if you actually speak french in the breakout rooms and participate, you'll learn. If you don't put the effort in I think it'd be really easy to skate through the class without getting a lot out of it though, easier than if you were actually in the classroom.\n\nI'm not finding it too difficult, there's a lot of homework but none of the tasks themselves are too hard.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rhkw", "created_utc": 1602957828}, {"subreddit_name": "mcgill", "author": "Arsiamon", "id": "g94gzva", "author_fullname": "t2_ltk2h2o", "score": 1, "body": "d.  was really shy in high school, always expected uni would be different but with lockdown i am starting to worry i will die alone :)))\n\nwho ever would have thought that i wouldn't make any connections over online frosh or zoom conferences?  when its just such a fun environment?", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rhkw", "created_utc": 1602957592}, {"subreddit_name": "mcgill", "author": "noodle_ass_bitch", "id": "g8x0cft", "author_fullname": "t2_3o5mnyjn", "score": 1, "body": "That is totally normal, and many people's grades rise a lot after first semester/first year as you get used to uni and start taking smaller courses. Also if you study a lot for your finals it's totally possible to maintain or improve your grades; thats what I did first year. I recommend rly engaging with conferences, tutorials and OH and studying with others if possible (over Zoom). \nAlso, zoom university sucks for a lot of people and how youre doing now doesnt necessarily reflect how youll do in a more \"normal\" university setting. I know many upper years who have withdrawn from multiple courses because they cant handle the increased stress and workload of online school. \nKeep trying ur hardest and focus on working \"smarter\" n making sure you understand and can use concepts you learn in class -- its hard to give more specific advice w/o knowing what ur studying.

Pretty sure 224 will be similar. You'll be reading different works and analyzing them. The assignments were straightforward. Prof Berman is AMAZING. she's one of the best I've had. She's really passionate and enthusiastic about the content and that spills over in her teaching. Read the material and be prepared for class, her teaching style is engagement heavy and I am guess she'll try to do that over zoom also.\nThe class average was B+ for 223 so should be similar for 224", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rhkw", "created_utc": 1602693533}]}
