I'm also doing my graduate studies. About to graduate this semester... i can relate so much to what you're going through. I've had that same hit when I started undergrad.

You can still come out and make the most of it. Graduate studies was never about the GPA, it's about the experience that you get out of it. This is part of the experience. You've been knocked down. It's okay, you're not invincible. The trick is to get back up. Learn from your mistakes and continue the fight. Find out where you went wrong and try to work on or fix. It's easier said than done. In your place I felt overwhelmed. But it gets better with time. \n\nWith last semester, i kept getting these panic attacks. When things were just not working. I found something that worked for me. Might not be the same exact thing that will work for you. You gotta find your safe zone to gather your thoughts and continue your work. \n\nObviously so many other people have offered to help and I'm extending my hand too.
