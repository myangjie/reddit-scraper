Confidentiality?\n\n-  2 days later, the student making the allegation published a story of their own.\n\n-  The university was asked to get involved but chose not to intervene in a possible rights violation.\n\n-  A lawyer selected and hired by the SSMU review led the case, sided with Mr. McCool, and cited numerous concerns with the SSMU process.\n\nQuestions:\n-  Does the SSMU have a privacy issue by violating McCool\u2019a right to confidentiality during an ongoing process.\n\n-  Does the SSMU even have the authority to adjudicate this type of allegation? (That would be no)\n\n-  What blame should the accuser assume?  Her statement in the McGill paper reads more like a social justice warrior manifesto than a truly personal account.  \n\n-  What blame does the university assume here for allowing Mr. McCool\u2019s reputation to be publicly damaged by all this?  I think the university should bare responsibility for choosing to let all this continue.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rhkw", "created_utc": 1606759614}]}
