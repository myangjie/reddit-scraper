I just graduated this past semester and while it was rough, I really feel for you guys as things definitely haven't improved.   Unfortunately Concordia teachers have been acting like snakes, thinking that students now have more free time to do work. One of my last classes had an absolutely heartless bastard who made the procedure for the final exam as hard as possible. One poor guy in the zoom session was on the verge of tears and the prof gave him the most smug looking expression.\n\nAll I can say is, you're halfway there. While it will feel like a mess for the foreseeable future, you're closer now than you've ever been and you can pull this off. Don't let those bastards get the better of you.
