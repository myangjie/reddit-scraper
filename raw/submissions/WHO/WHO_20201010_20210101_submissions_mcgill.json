My reading comprehension is fine but I\u2019m so incredibly slow at reading that I scored the in the 7th percentile when tested. For those who don\u2019t know what that means, just know that it\u2019s really, really bad. \n\nI\u2019m in a field that\u2019s super reading heavy. It only works out cuz I spend 3-4x the amount of time on my readings as other students. I\u2019m usually able to handle this but recently I just couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes on the page. I couldn\u2019t stop my train of thoughts. I was failing to recognize simple words and I had 7 other things I also needed to get done. Ultimately I just wasn\u2019t able to do it within a timeframe that came anywhere close to reasonable and, one whole month later, I finally fucking read all the damn readings and picked the one I wanted. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I was going to get any sympathy for this. I fully expected (and deserved) to lose marks but despite being super anxious I somehow managed to actually send my prof the damn email. \n\nI told him about how my ADHD and dyslexia have been making it really hard for me to, well, read. I threw in some self deprecation and several apologies. I fully prepped myself to get written off/penalized. Instead, I got the nicest possible reply and it warmed my heart. \n\nThis prof had voluntarily given me an extension for a different assignment I didn\u2019t even ask for (but definitely needed), told me not to worry about this in the future and communicate my issues instead, and asked me if there was any else he could do to help me.\n\nWho does that? I ghosted for a month but was given a free extension anyway and then he offered to do even more!? It\u2019s nice to see that this kind of tolerance exists and at a university level. \n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of frustrated rants on here lately (understandably) and I thought my actually good prof experience might help spread some of the happiness I got out of it.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rhkw", "subreddit_subscribers": 30070, "created_utc": 1602982570, "num_comments": 21, "title": "I was finally able to send my teacher an email saying that I\u2019d picked my presentation date - a task I was expected to complete over month ago...", "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"subreddit_name": "mcgill", "author": "tajajaja", "author_fullname": "t2_5g19fybk", "id": "jd05qp", "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a particularly amazing professor who has consistently gone above and beyond to help me.

Should I attach a CV or transcript (given that I have a high GPA) to my email?
