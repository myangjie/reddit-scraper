ceo is saying two doses of the vaccine offers very limited protection if any. 3 doses with a booster offer reasonable protection against hospitalization and deaths. less protection against infection. source he is essentially saying that 2 doses do nothing for the variants and even 3 doses booster dont offer total protection from illnessdeath and is even less effective for stopping transmission. the takeaway from his statement is that the current effectiveness of the vaccines needs to be reexamined asap and if true he is a business man after all makes the mandates and all the brouhaha silly. he also says in the video that a vaccine for the variants including omicron will be ready in march. this means at least two other shots for double vaccinated people. but ive read about a lot of projection models from experts that speculate omicron is actually a good thing and these two optimistic articles sum it up quite well. 1. omicron could act as natural vaccine and speed up virus becoming endemic experts claim 2. scientists believe ultrainfectious strain may kill 100 times fewer people than delta and mortality rates were already similar to influenza before the variant emerged ampx200b ive read dozens of studies and countless articles in my little search for clarity and found these two studies with imho the most sound should be common sense conclusions to end the post with. 1. in summary even as efforts should be made to encourage populations to get vaccinated it should be done so with humility and respect. stigmatizing populations can do more harm than good. importantly other nonpharmacological prevention efforts e.g. the importance of basic public health hygiene with regards to maintaining safe distance or handwashing promoting better frequent and cheaper forms of testing needs to be renewed in order to strike the balance of learning to live with covid19 in the same manner we continue to live a 100 years later with various seasonal alterations of the 1918 influenza virus. source 2. many decisionmakers assume that the vaccinated can be excluded as a source of transmission. it appears to be grossly negligent to ignore the vaccinated population as a possible and relevant source of transmission when deciding about public health control measures. source i am always a dick so im certainly not the right person to say this but dont be dicks to each other. dicks bad. unless thats what youre into.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnmr", "subreddit_subscribers": 182237, "created_utc": 1641958037, "num_comments": 0, "title": "stop fearmongering its not as bad
